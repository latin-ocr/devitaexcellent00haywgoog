Ι. > Apology of 1118, author. The manner in ’ which the Spar-
tans get possession of Thebes: Expulsion of Pelopidas and
others. ΙΙ. They repair to Athe'ns, to wait the opportunity of
liberating their country ,ι Twelve of them go to Thebes, as if
without design, on a feast day of the magistrates. III. The
latter, through their extreme carelessness, are all assassinated
at the banquet3 and the Lacedaemonian ''garrison is expelled.
IV. This was purely the achievement of Pelopidas3 but of
most of his other exploits he shares the glory with Epami-
nondas. V. Adversity 'of Pelopidas: When οιι an embassy to
Thessaly, his person is seized by Alexander of Pherae, · in a
war of revenge against whom for this contempt, Pelopidas loses
1118 life, though his cause is victorious: Tribute of the Thessalian
cities to his memory.
