traciam. There was at Athens, near the market, a place fenced
in with· rails, into which any citizen might throw a shall or tile,
on which he had written the name of any great man whom he
wished to have banlshed. At st'ated periods, these were counted
by the archons; and if they exceeded 6,000‚ the person whose
name was found οιι the majority Was banished for te'n
years. His property, however, was not confiscated; but was
preserved for him till his return. Some say that the names
were written on shells ; and others, on tiles, or pieces of broken
earthen ware: and the latter is the more probable, as the word
Qffragium, derived from sub and frangere, means a svmll frag·
ment ; and was probably adopted to signify a vote, because
votes were written on such &ecee—Argos ε not the accusa-
tive plural, but the singular of the third deciension, neuter
gender: Argos, gen. Argeos or Argis, as in line 13, below. Greek
