33. Opprimere: ‘to crush, tuin, overthrow, destroy.’

1. Gradu depulsus est. The phrase' is bon-owed from the glad· 12
iators. Gradus is the position chosen. ·De gradu dejici, ‘ to be

· thrown down fron} the position 3' de gradu depelli, ‘ to be driven

from the position.’ Eodem refers to Themistocles.

2. Certiorem eam fecit. ’ This means more than merely to
inform, or apprize; as it ¹'implies 'that pains were taken to do it ;

used of one's self: certiorem 'sefecit, ‘ took pains to ascertain.’

3. Id agi .- ‘ that it was in agitation‚’ ‘ that exertions were mak-
ing.' This is a peculiar phrase: the pronoun id has no antece·
dent, but refersto the following clause3 being used superfluously‚
and· always followed by ut with the subjunctive, where the pro-
noun itself would be omitted in English, with the following verb
in the infinitivo. . The above sentence literally is, ‘ that this was
in agitation, namelgh that the bridge might be destroyed? whereas
in English we should say, ‘ that it was in agitation to destroy
‘the bridge' ¹

the Athenians made use of, was neither large nor good.’ See
note to p. 10,1. 21. Many such simple sentences occur, which
can be rendered into good English only by being considered as
compound; that is, by being made into two; supplying the rela-
tive in the first, and some form of the verb to be in the ·
second. ²

19. Praecipuo periculo suo.- at his own particular peril.'

21. Negarem oportere, dec. Here, ‘ to deny that it is neces·
sary to have a thing,' is used for‘ to affirm that it was necessary
not to have it) To dewy is το affirm the negative; and the neg-
ative part of negarent should here be transferred to haberi, or to
ullam; thus, ‘ they might affirm or maintain that it was neces·
sary that any city should not be had, i. e. that no city should
be had, beyond the Peloponnesus.’ A similar expression² occurs
